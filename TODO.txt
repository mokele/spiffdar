* List persistence
* User persistence
* OpenID login
* Create anonymous sessions when a list is saved.  It'd be great if someone could use Spiffdar without having to login at all unless they want to use it via different machines/browsers.  An anonymous session cookie can be used until the point at which someone wishes to login with an OpenID.  Even picking of a username can be done without any need for authentication.  Clear notification of this state should be visible at all times.  Maybe use recaptcha when setting a username if not authenticated? otherwise someone could bot registration of lots of usernames.
* Display each resolution's source
* Handle multiple results for per track and let the viewer change which one to use.
* Remote player controls via iPhone or other machine.

* RJ2: mokele: i was thinking that i want to be able to click a link on a lastfm album page and end up on spiffdar with the album tracklist loaded in
[16:51] RJ2: or maybe click the link for a track chart somewhere on lastfm and toss it all into spiffdar
[16:51] RJ2: could you accept POST data with a tracklist in and autocreate a list?
[16:52] RJ2: something simple for now like  artist<Tab>album<Tab>track<Tab><newline>...
[16:53] RJ2: i'm not quite ready to wield JSPF yet
