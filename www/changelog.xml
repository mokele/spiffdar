    <title>Recovery and resolution source fallback on stream errors</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      If you're using the Seeqpod python plugin for Playdar then you'll notice that some tracks fail to stream sometimes.  Well now Spiffdar will gracefully handle with that and skip onto either the next available resolved source for that track or onto the next track in the list.  It made more sense to put the stream error checking into playdar.js so committed that to my www.playdar.org fork and hopefully that finds it's way into the live playdar code.  It would have been great for this callback to be handled by SoundManager2, but couldn't find any way of doing that, so had to come up with the crude 4 second timeout. Might query Scott about that at some point.

    <title>Multiple Resolutions Switching</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      If a little pair of parentheses with a number in show up next to the source info under a track then that means it's resolved more than once.  You can now give this a click and select a different source for playback, Huzzah!

    <title>Style tweeks and auth resolving after auth fix</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      When Spiffdar first connects/auths via Playdar the resolutions now occur based on a callback from that, so there's now no need to refresh the page.  This will help a lot when linking new users to Spiffdar and to help explain Playdar more clearly.  Along with this some minor style tweaks have been made to fit in the extra Playdar source info to each track.

    <title>Saving brand new lists</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      Brand new lists can now be saved by clicking the save button.  This was a quick addition so just threw it live.  It still needs the ability to edit exisiting lists and create copies of external spiffs to then edit.

    <title>Session Based List Saving</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      When you view a list in Spiffdar now it'll get pinned to the top left of the page above the hard-coded lists.  This is the first step towards persistence and editing of lists that's planned.  If you want to keep the lists you've added then just make sure not to delete your cookies or else the session that Spiffdar gives you will get lost and you'll not be able to retrieve the lists you've added.  At a later date when Spiffdar forces you to login (e.g. via OpenID) then we can save your lists permanently.
