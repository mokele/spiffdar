    <title>Saving brand new lists</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      Brand new lists can not be saved by clicking the save button.  This was a quick addition so just threw it live.  It still needs the ability to edit exisiting lists and create copies of external spiffs to then edit.

    <title>Session Based List Saving</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
      When you view a list in Spiffdar now it'll get pinned to the top left of the page above the hard-coded lists.  This is the first step towards persistence and editing of lists that's planned.  If you want to keep the lists you've added then just make sure not to delete your cookies or else the session that Spiffdar gives you will get lost and you'll not be able to retrieve the lists you've added.  At a later date when Spiffdar forces you to login (e.g. via OpenID) then we can save your lists permanently.
